=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package YourApplication::Config;

  use Config::Singleton -setup => {
    filename => 'something.yaml',
    template => {
      foo => undef,
      bar => 1024,
      qux => [ 1, 2, 3],
    },
  };

Elsewhere...

  use YourApplication::Config 'my_instance_config.yml';

  my $foo = YourApplication::Config->foo;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Config::Singleton provides a base class for access to configuration data for
your app. The basic implementation stores its configuration in YAML in a text
file found in all the usual places. By default, Config::Singleton looks for
myapp.yml, but an alternate filename may be passed when using the module.

This module was derived from L<Rubric::Config|Rubric::Config>.

=head1 USING APP::CONFIG

The L</SYNOPSIS> section, above, demonstrates an example of almost every
feature of Config::Singleton  It's a very simple module with a very small
interface.

It is not a base class.  It is a utility for setting up a class that stores
loaded configuration data.  You just need to C<use> the module like this:

  package Your::Config;

  use Config::Singleton -setup => {
    filename => 'your_program.yaml',
    template => {
      username => undef,
      hostname => undef,
      logfile  => undef,
      facility => 'local1',
      path     => [ qw(/var/spool /tmp/jobs) ],
    },
  };

When another module uses Your::Config, F<your_program.yaml> will be loaded and
its contents will be merged over the defaults given by the C<template>
argument.  Each entry in the template hashref becomes a method on
YourProgram::Config, which returns either the value from the config file or the
value from the template, if no entry exists in the config file.

So, assuming that F<your_program.yaml> looks like this:

  ---
  username: rjbs
  hostname: fulfill.example.com

  path:
    - /var/spool/jobs
    - /home/rjbs/spool/jobs

Then these are the results of method calls on Your::Config:

  Your::Config->username; # 'rjbs'

  Your::Config->logfile;  # undef

  Your::Config->facility; # 'local0'

  Your::Config->path;     # qw(/var/spool/jobs  /home/rjbs/spool/jobs)

=head2 Specifying a Config File

Config::Singleton finds a config file via a series of DWIM-my steps that are
probably
more complicated to explain than they are to understand.

The F<filename> argument given when using Config::Singleton is the name of the
file that will, by default, be loaded to find configuration.  It may be
absolute or relative.  If not given, it's computed as follows:  the "module
base name" is made by dropping the last part of the class name, if it's
multi-part, and double colons become underscores.  In other words
"Your::Thing::Config" becomes "Your_Thing."  If the environment variable
YOUR_THING_CONFIG_FILE is set, that will be used as the default.  If not,
F<your_thing.yaml> will be used.

The named file will be the source of configuration for the global (class
method) configuration.  It can be overridden, however, when using the config
module.  For example, after using the following code:

  use Your::Thing::Config 'special.yaml';

...the default name will have been replaced with F<special.yaml>.  If the
previous default file has already been loaded, this will throw an exception.
Using the module without specifying a filename will defer loading of the
configuration file until it's needed.  To force it to be loaded without setting
an explicit filename, pass C<-load> as the filename.  (All names beginning
with a dash are reserved.)

If the filename is relative, the configuration file is found by looking for the
file name in the following paths (F<LOC> is the location of the program being
run, found via C<$0>):

  ./
  ../
  LOC/
  LOC/../etc/
  ~/
  /etc/

You can change the paths checked by providing a F<path> argument, as an
arrayref, in the setup arguments.

=head2 Alternate Configuration Objects

Although it's generally preferable to begin your program by forcing the loading
of a configuration file and then using the global configuration, it's possible
to have multiple Your::Thing::Config configurations loaded by instantiating
objects of that class, like this:

  my $config_obj = Your::Thing::Config->new($filename);

The named file is found via the same path resolution (if it's relative) as
described above.

=head1 METHODS

Config::Singleton doesn't actually have any real public methods of its own.
Its methods are all private, and serve to power its C<import> routine.  These
will probably be exposed in the future to allow for subclassing of
Config::Singleton, but in the meantime, don't rely on them.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Ricardo SIGNES not only wrote the inspiration for this in Rubric::Config, but
he also basically wrote the majority of the implementation here, and even
provided extensions of what he knew I wanted it to do, even when I said I
didn't need that yet. In the end it ended up being extremely elegant, which I
can say without being boastful, because he wrote the elegant bits.
